# Airhorndroid

## Informations and usage

Airhorndroid is a simple android companion app to triggger airhorn calls on the awesome [hammerandchisel's airhorn discord bot](https://github.com/hammerandchisel/airhornbot) without have to type any text. When you are in game, it is impractical to switch to discord window just to type "!airhorn". That's why I built this app.  
It is very easy to use. Just launch it, type your credentials and validate.  
You will be notified that you have been successfully connected !  
Then you're on the main screen. Under settings menu, you can choose your target guild.  

The main screen holds 5 buttons you can press to make !airhorn calls.  
Currently mapping is as follow:  
- 1 button -> !airhorn default
- 2 button -> !airhorn reverb
- middle button -> !airhorn
- 3 button -> !airhorn tripletap
- 4 button -> !airhorn fourtap


## Dependencies

The app uses the mighty [android-async-http library](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) from loopj.  
It also uses a class from a [gist](https://gist.github.com/ayvazj/6e8dcf689be7cec89579). Many thanks to ayvazj for that.
