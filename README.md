#Airhorndroid

##Informations and usage

Airhorndroid is a simple android app to triggger airhorn calls on the awesome [hammerandchisel's airhorn discord bot](https://github.com/hammerandchisel/airhornbot) without have to type any text.  
It is very easy to use. Just launch it, type your credentials and validate.  
You will be notified that you have been successfully connected !  
Then you're on the main screen. Under settings menu, you can choose your target guild and channel.  
The main screen holds 4 buttons : 1, 2, 3, 4 that you can press to make !airhorn calls.  
Currently mapping is as follow:  
- 1 button -> !airhorn default
- 2 button -> !airhorn reverb
- 3 button -> !airhorn tripletap
- 4 button -> !airhorn fourtap

##Roadmap

- Improve app design. Wear it with the airhorn bot colors ;)

##Dependencies

The app uses the mighty [android-async-http library](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) from loopj.  
It also uses a class from a [gist](https://gist.github.com/ayvazj/6e8dcf689be7cec89579). Many thanks to ayvazj for that.
